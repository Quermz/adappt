### Overview

- This application is built using Typescript and React.

- I chose to represent the coordinates of the shapes using a proportion of the windows view width. This was so that upon resizing the screen the shapes would remain in the same place proportionally.

- The shapes scale based on the view width to conform to different screens sizes such as mobile.

- I got the clip path values for my hexagon, triangle and square from https://css-generators.com/polygon-shape/
